    <string name="resonator_description">Resonators are deployed on a portal in order to capture it or upgrade existing resonators.</string>
    <string name="resonator_notes">There\'s a limit of resonators of one level a player can deploy on one portal:\n1x L8\n1x L7\n2x L6\n2x L5\n4x L4\n4x L3\n4x L2\n8x L1.</string>
    <string name="powercubes_description">Power Cubes are used to refill your XM bar.</string>
    <string name="powercubes_notes">XM gain is calculted by mutliplying the level by 1000.</string>
    <string name="portalkey_description">Portalkeys are the most important gain of a Hack. With portal keys you are able to link portal A to portal B if you\'re in the range of portal A and if you have a key of portal B. Also are keys useful to recharge portals when not in their range.</string>
    <string name="portalkey_notes">Once you\'ve hacked a key out of a portal, you won\'t be able to hack another one unless you drop the key or store it in a capsule.</string>
    <string name="shields_description">Shields are a portal\'s bodyguard. They decrease an XMP\'s attack damage. 2 attributes define a shield\'s behavior: Mitigation and Stickiness. Mitigation is the shield\'s protecting abilty. The stickiness effect describes the shield\'s lasting ability, whether it lasts long or not long to XMP attacks.</string>
    <string name="shield_notes">no notes for disss</string>
    <string name="axashield_notes">There are currently rumours out there which are saying that the hack output is slightly increased when hacking a portal of an AXA Building. It\'s in the internet, it must be true..</string>
    <string name="heatsink_notes">no notes for dissss</string>
    <string name="multihack_description">A multihack is used to increase the max. amount of hacks that can be done in 4  hours (after the first hack). A standard portal can be hacked up to 4 times. Take a look at our simulator to experiment with multihack-effects.</string>
    <string name="multihack_notes">Portal burned out but you don\'t want to wait 4 hours to hack again? See if there is an empty mod slot and put in a multihack to get rid of the cooldown.</string>
    <string name="forceamp_notes">lorem ipsum an den leschten mecht d dier zou</string>
    <string name="turret_description">Turrets are mods and are used to increase the frequency of a portal\'s attack. F.e. a portal does not always shoot back when you hack or attack it, but with the turrets, you can change this probability.</string>
    <string name="turret_notes">no such notes 00null00</string>
    <string name="linkamps_notes">Very rare link amps can only be received by redeeming a password. They are mostly distributed after having participated at an anomaly.</string>
    <string name="softbankultralinkamp_description">Softbank Ultra Link Amps have many features. They can increase the link range of a portal, they can act as a shield and they can also max the limit of 8 outbound links to 16 (per SBULA).</string>
    <string name="softbankultralinkamp_notes">no such notes</string>
    <string name="capsule_notes">no such notes</string>
    <string name="mufgcapsules_description">MUFG capsules are awesome. They have made getting very rare items much easier, due to the awesome fact that they duplicate items after a certain time that you\'ve them in. Also, every item you put in a MUFG, will no longer take away space of your inventory limit of 2000 items.</string>
    <string name="mufgcapsule_notes">none</string>
    <string name="fracker_notes">To be used on a fast pace hacking portal or in a group of few people.</string>
    <string name="keylocker_notes">no special notes</string>
    <string name="beacon_notes">nothing special</string>
    <string name="xmp_description">XMP\'s are weapons used to attack enemy portals. XMP\'s from different levels have different ranges of attack (see Ingress App).</string>
    <string name="xmp_notes">They are easy to hack but easy to waste.</string>
    <string name="ultrastrike_description">Different to XMPs do Ultra Strikes more damage but in a much tinier area. That\'s why they are used to destroy shields (by staying the nearest to the middle of a portal) or to destroy single resonators by staying on them as well.</string>
    <string name="ultrastrike_notes">Don\'t waste them, they are not that common in hacks.</string>
    <string name="ada_description">Ada Refactor and Jarvis Virus are weapons used to instantly change a portal\'s alignment. Once applied on a portal, mods and resonators stay the same, but the name and the faction of the portal changes and links are being destroyed.</string>
    <string name="ada_notes">Don\'t waste them. You don\'t get AP for destroying resonators, links or fields when using an ADA or Jarvis.</string>
    <string name="axashield_description">AXA shields are the best shields in Ingress. They have the highest shielding and stickiness effect. As you might guess, they have been introduced in cooperation with AXA (assurance company).</string>
    <string name="heatsink_description">Heatsinks are mods to decrease the waiting time between 2 hacks on the same portal. The standard amount of waiting time is 5 minutes but with heat sinks you can decrease this time to even lower than 1 minute! (See our Portal Simulator)</string>
    <string name="forceamp_description">Forceamps are mods to give a portal the power to answer with more damage by attacking a player. (See Portal Sim.)</string>
    <string name="linkamp_description">Linkamps are mods to increase the maximum link range of a portal.</string>
    <string name="capsule_description">You can store any item in capsules (except capsules..) but they wont free you space in your inventory.</string>
    <string name="fracker_description">Fracker are Powerups which can be bought in the Store in Ingress. When used on a Portal, they double the hack output for 10 minutes or for 150 hacks, whatever comes first.</string>
    <string name="keylocker_description">Keylocker are good alternatives to MUFG capsules. Keylocker can only store keys but they do free space in your inventory. They can be bought in the Ingress Store as well.</string>
    <string name="beacon_description">Beacons are simple marks on the scanner over a portal. For some they are more a fun item than a utility item. They can be found in the store as well, under 4 different variations.</string>
