    <string name="ada_description"><u>Description&#58;</u> \n ADA Refactor and Jarvis Virus are weapons used to instantly switch a Portal\'s alignment.They are gained, just as any other weapons, by hacking a Portal \n All the mods and resonators stay the same after the use of a Jarvis or ADA, only the name changes.
                                      \n \n <u>Important tips:</u> \n You can only attack the same Portal with an ADA /Jarvis once per hour. If you try to use one before the 1 hour cooldown, the Portal\'s alignment won\'t change and your ADA or Jarvis will be gone.</string>
    <string name="axa_description">AXA shields are the most powerful shields in Ingress. \n They have the highest mitigation and stickiness, which means that they provide the best defense and that they are the hardest to destroy.\n They are earned as any other shields by hacking, but they are considered as very rare. \n\n As you might guess, AXA shields were introduced with the Insurance Company AXA </string>
    <string name="beacon_description">Beacons can be found in the Store in the Ingress App. There are currently 4 different beacons: ENL Beacon, RES Beacon, Target Beacon and Meetup Beacon. \n \n The functionality of those beacons is to put them onto a Portal and they will appear as a big mark on the scanner. \n For some it is a fun tool, for some it is useful, especially in anomalies.  </string>
    <string name="capsule_description">Capsules are storaging items. You can store in whatever you want, to a maximum of 100 items per Capsule. They can be gained by hacking but are considered as rare. \n \n<u>Notice&#58;</u> \n Unfortunately, they cannot, as the MUFG capsules, free storage space of your inventory. </string>
    <string name="forceamp_description">Forceamps are the nasty mods on an enemy portal which decide on how much damage you take from a portal\'s back-attack, after you\'ve attacked or hacked it. \n (Not every hack ends in an attack by the portal. See Turrets). </string>
    <string name="fracker_description">Portalfracker can be found in the Store as well.  They are part of the "Powerups" and are pretty useful. \n\n What a portal fracker does is basically it doubles the hack output for 10 minutes OR 150 hacks. \n\n So if you\'re wanting to use one, be sure to spend them with other people, otherwise they are too expensive because as 1 person you won\'t get 150 hacks in 10 minutes. </string>
    <string name="heatsink_description">First introduced in Ingress v1.28.1, the Heatsink is used to decrease the waiting/cooldown time between 2 hacks of the same portal. \n \n They come as many other mods in a common, rare and very rare edition. Since it is so hard to calculate the effects of the HS\'s, we\'ve build in a Portal Simulator.  </string>
    <string name="jarvis_description"><u>Description&#58;</u> \n ADA Refactor and Jarvis Virus are weapons used to instantly switch a Portal\'s alignment.They are gained, just as any other weapons, by hacking a Portal \n All the mods and resonators stay the same after the use of a Jarvis or ADA, only the name changes.
                                      \n \n <u>Important tips:</u> \n You can only attack the same Portal with an ADA /Jarvis once per hour. If you try to use one before the 1 hour cooldown, the Portal\'s alignment won\'t change and your ADA or Jarvis will be gone.</string>
    <string name="keylocker_description">Keylockers are similar to capsules, but they can only store keys. \n In addition, the amount of keys you put in the keylocker will free up space of your inventory. \n\n You can get them in the Ingress store as well.</string>
    <string name="linkamp_description"> Link amplifier (short Linkamps) are used to increase the link range of a portal. \n\n They only appear in a rare and a very rare form. However you can get the very rare link amp only with a passcode. \n \n Our Portal Sim also includes a link range calculator.</string>
